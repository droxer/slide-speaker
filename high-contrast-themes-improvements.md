- Consistent focus styling across all interactive elements

### 2. Button Styles Alignment

  - Dark Theme: Black background with white text and white border
  - Light Theme: Black background with white text and black border
  - Enhanced hover effects with transform and shadow transitions

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Both high contrast themes now align with their respective regular themes
2. **Accessibility**: Enhanced contrast and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.1 standards
3. **Usability**: Improved visual feedback and consistent design patterns
4. **Maintainability**: Themes follow the same structure as the regular themes, making future updates easier

## Technical Details

- Used `!important` declarations to ensure styles override default theme styles
- Preserved all existing class selectors and structure for compatibility
- Enhanced transitions and hover effects for better user experience
- Maintained consistent spacing, padding, and border radius values
