# Accessibility Audit Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive accessibility audit of the SlideSpeaker web application, evaluating compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and other accessibility best practices.

## 1. Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility

### Findings
- The application uses a consistent color palette with good contrast ratios for most text elements
- Semantic color coding is used for status indicators (green for completed, blue for processing, etc.)
- Focus states are visually distinct with clear outlines
- Text sizing uses relative units for better scalability

### Recommendations
- Consider adding a high contrast mode for users with low vision
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Add reduced motion preferences for animations

## 2. Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management

### Findings
- Good keyboard navigation support in dropdown menus (Escape key closes menus)
- Focus management is implemented for modal dialogs
- Tab navigation follows logical order
- Focus indicators are visible for interactive elements

### Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Add skip navigation links for screen reader users
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- Add focus trapping for modal dialogs

## 3. Semantic HTML and ARIA Attributes

### Findings
- Proper use of semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, etc.)
- ARIA attributes are used appropriately for dynamic content
- Role attributes are correctly applied to interactive components
- Live regions are used for dynamic status updates

### Recommendations
- Add more descriptive labels for form controls
- Implement landmark roles for better page structure
- Ensure all ARIA attributes have matching IDs
- Add aria-describedby for complex interactions

## 4. Screen Reader Compatibility

### Findings
- Status updates use aria-live for announcements
- Form elements have appropriate labels
- Navigation elements have clear headings
- Modal dialogs use proper ARIA roles

### Recommendations
- Conduct testing with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Add more descriptive alt text for decorative elements
- Implement skip links for faster navigation
- Provide audio cues for important status changes

## 5. Specific Component Analysis

### Task Dashboard
- Task IDs are now displayed in full without truncation
- Improved visual styling with better contrast
- Status badges only shown for in-progress tasks as requested
- Copy functionality with visual feedback

### Header Component
- User menu with proper keyboard support
- View toggle with tab roles and proper labeling
- Loading states with aria-live announcements

### Media Players
- Native HTML5 controls for better accessibility
- Transcript synchronization for audio content
- Keyboard shortcuts for media controls

## 6. Mobile and Touch Accessibility

### Findings
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Touch targets are appropriately sized
- Mobile-friendly navigation patterns

### Recommendations
- Add touch gestures for media controls
- Ensure adequate spacing for touch targets
- Implement orientation change handling

## 7. Cognitive Accessibility

### Findings
- Clear visual hierarchy and consistent layouts
- Simple, jargon-free language
- Consistent navigation patterns

### Recommendations
- Add tooltips for complex functionality
- Provide clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- Implement consistent iconography with text labels

## 8. Priority Improvements

### High Priority
1. Add skip navigation links
2. Implement focus trapping for modals
3. Add high contrast mode option
4. Conduct screen reader testing

### Medium Priority
1. Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
2. Improve form error messaging
3. Add reduced motion preferences
4. Implement landmark roles

### Low Priority
1. Add tooltips for all interactive elements
2. Provide alternative text for all images
3. Add language switching accessibility
4. Implement print styles

## 9. Compliance Summary

The application demonstrates a good foundation for accessibility with:
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Appropriate ARIA attribute usage
- Good keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast

Areas for improvement include:
- More comprehensive screen reader testing
- Additional keyboard shortcuts
- High contrast mode implementation
- Skip navigation functionality

## 10. Next Steps

1. Conduct user testing with people with disabilities
2. Implement high-priority recommendations
3. Establish accessibility testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline
4. Create accessibility documentation for future development
