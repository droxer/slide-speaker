# High Contrast Theme Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of separate high contrast themes for both light and dark modes. The implementation provides users with two high contrast options that maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance while offering better visual comfort.

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme System Updates
- Modified `ThemeProvider.tsx` to support separate high contrast modes:
  - `high-contrast-light`: High contrast version of the light theme
  - `high-contrast-dark`: High contrast version of the dark theme
- Updated theme initialization logic to handle new theme modes
- Modified body class toggling to apply appropriate CSS classes

### 2. Theme Toggle Component
- Updated `ThemeToggle.tsx` to include two separate high contrast options
- Added new translation key `highContrastDark` for the dark high contrast mode
- Updated button titles and labels for clarity

### 3. Translation Updates
- Added `highContrastDark` translation key to all language files:
  - English: "HC Dark"
  - Traditional Chinese: "高對比暗色"
  - Simplified Chinese: "高对比暗色"
  - Japanese: "ハイコントラスト(暗)"
  - Korean: "고대비 다크"
  - Thai: "ความเปรียบต่างสูงมืด"

### 4. CSS Styles
- Created separate SCSS files for each high contrast theme:
  - `src/styles/themes/high-contrast/light.scss`: High contrast light theme
  - `src/styles/themes/high-contrast/dark.scss`: High contrast dark theme
- Removed old combined `high-contrast.scss` file
- Updated `src/styles/index.scss` to import new theme files

### 5. High Contrast Light Theme Features
- Maintains the same color palette as the regular light theme
- Enhanced focus indicators with 3px solid black outline
- High-contrast buttons with bold text and clear borders
- Enhanced form elements with 2px solid black borders
- Distinct status indicators with high visibility
- Improved skip links with better visual feedback
- Enhanced scrollbars for better visibility

### 6. High Contrast Dark Theme Features
- Maintains the same color palette as the regular dark theme
- Enhanced focus indicators with 3px solid white outline
- High-contrast buttons with bold text and clear borders (white on black)
- Enhanced form elements with 2px solid white borders
- Distinct status indicators optimized for dark backgrounds
- Improved skip links with better visual feedback
- Enhanced scrollbars for better visibility on dark backgrounds

## Benefits
1. **Better Accessibility**: Users can now choose high contrast mode that matches their preferred theme (light or dark)
2. **WCAG Compliance**: Both themes maintain full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **Visual Comfort**: Reduced contrast intensity (1.1 instead of 1.2) for more comfortable viewing
4. **Consistency**: Each theme maintains the visual language of its base theme while enhancing contrast
5. **Flexibility**: Users can switch between regular and high contrast versions of their preferred theme

## Testing
All changes have been verified to:
- ✅ Build successfully without errors
- ✅ Pass all existing tests
- ✅ Pass linting and type checking
- ✅ Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ Work correctly across all supported languages
- ✅ Not introduce any visual regressions

## Usage
Users can now select from 5 theme options:
1. Auto - System preference
2. Light - Regular light theme
3. Dark - Regular dark theme
4. High Contrast - High contrast version of light theme
5. HC Dark - High contrast version of dark theme
