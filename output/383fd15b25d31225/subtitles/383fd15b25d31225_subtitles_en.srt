1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,805
Immersive teaching shows how technology can support the

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:04,005
full learning

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:04,605
cycle.

4
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,311
Before class, teachers work with intelligent tools to

5
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,265
generate a personalized set of practice questions, concise

6
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:12,774
content summaries, and key terms tailored to each

7
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:13,574
learner.

8
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:16,541
The goal is to reduce prep time and quickly identify where

9
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,341
students

10
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:17,941
stand.

11
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,895
In the classroom, real‑time interactive Q&A keeps students

12
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,799
engaged, invites immediate discussion, and tests ideas on

13
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,057
the spot to deepen

14
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:26,285
understanding.

15
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:29,318
After class, automatic grading handles routine assignments,

16
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:32,223
delivering instant feedback and freeing teachers to focus

17
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:33,675
on guidance and higher‑value

18
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:34,175
work.

19
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,036
Three pillars—tailored practice, active participation,

20
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,669
timely feedback—link preparation, instruction, and

21
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:40,769
assessment.

22
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,674
Before class, teachers collaborate with intelligent tools

23
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:46,094
to build a personalized practice set for each

24
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:46,894
learner.

25
00:00:46,894 --> 00:00:49,852
The system analyzes prior results, then generates targeted

26
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,359
questions, quick content summaries, and essential

27
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,259
keywords.

28
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,323
This tailored preparation reduces planning time and gives a

29
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,928
clear view of each student’s current understanding,

30
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,142
strengths, and

31
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:00,642
gaps.

32
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:03,438
In turn, teachers enter class with a precise map of

33
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,314
learning needs, ready to guide students through targeted

34
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,414
activities.

35
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:10,395
With this foundation, instruction can adapt in real time,

36
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,999
keeping pace with diverse learners and accelerating

37
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,099
progress for

38
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:14,999
everyone.
